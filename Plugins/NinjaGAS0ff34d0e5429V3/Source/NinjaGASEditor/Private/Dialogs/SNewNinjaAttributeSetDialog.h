/**
 * The Dialog used to create new Attribute Sets based on Ninja GAS.
 *
 * Built using "SNewClassDialog" as a starting reference, which is the dialog used when you
 * click "New C++ Class" in the Editor.
 *
 * The purpose of this dialog is to create an Attribute Set class (or update its contents),
 * based on the Data Table that would be used to initialize its values.
 *
 * Providing a Data Table to an Attribute Set that was already created in the main project
 * path would recreate its contents. The dialog can only modify Attribute Sets in the main
 * project folders. Plugins always must be excluded.
